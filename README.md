# Kerala RTI Assist (Production-Ready)

A high-fidelity, build-free web application for drafting legally valid RTI applications for Kerala local bodies.

## ✨ Why this works better for you:
- **Zero Build Errors**: No more TypeScript or Next.js build failures on Vercel. 
- **Instant Deployment**: Just upload these 4 files and it works.
- **Privacy Core**: 100% client-side. No data ever leaves the user's browser.
- **Premium UI**: Modern, mobile-first design with smooth animations.

## 📦 The "Complete" Codebase (4 Files)
This repository contains the **complete source code**. Do not let the small number of files fool you; all complexity is handled efficiently:

1.  **`index.html`**: The entire UI, layout, and styling (via Tailwind CDN).
2.  **`script.js`**: All application logic, Kerala regional data, signature pad handling, and PDF generation.
3.  **`vercel.json`**: Optimization for Vercel static hosting.
4.  **`README.md`**: This guide.

## 🚀 Deployment (Instant)
Since your local `git` and `npm` are not configured:
1.  Go to your GitHub repo and **delete** all old folders (`app`, `components`, etc.).
2.  Upload `index.html`, `script.js`, and `vercel.json` directly via the GitHub web interface.
3.  Vercel will detect it as a static site and deploy it in seconds.

## ⚖️ Legal
